# LibLoL Compatibility

libLoL (LoongArch on LoongArch) is a runtime that provides old-world ABI compatibility.

If you don't know why you need libLoL, or if you need information about where old-world and new-world application incompatibilities come from, see the LoongArch opensource community's AreWeLoongYet? site for article [Old World and New World](https://areweloongyet.com/en/docs/old-and-new-worlds) and article [The Old World and the New World (Low-Level Details)](https://areweloongyet.com/en/docs/world-compat-details).
